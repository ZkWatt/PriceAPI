# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

ZkWatt is a specialized Layer 2 scaling solution built on Ethereum, designed specifically for the energy and electricity markets. It combines zero-knowledge rollups with a decentralized oracle network to provide high-frequency, verifiable price feeds and facilitate efficient off-grid energy trading networks.

The platform addresses three critical challenges in the energy oracle space:
1. High-frequency price updates with minimal on-chain footprint
2. Verifiable off-grid energy data integration
3. Cost-effective settlement of energy trading transactions

By leveraging ZK rollup technology, ZkWatt can process thousands of price updates and energy trading transactions per second while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum network.
